For the latter, in some walking scenes, Warwick Davis incarnated Yoda as well. For the radio dramatizations of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, Yoda was voiced by John Lithgow, while Tom Kane voiced him in the Clone Wars animated series, several video games, and the new series Star Wars: The Clone Wars.\"\n",

He initially wants to join the Imperial Academy to become a pilot with his childhood friend Biggs Darklighter, but is held back by his uncle who ostensibly needs his help on the moisture farm (while it was to hopefully prevent Luke from following his father's path). He takes his first steps toward his destiny when he finds the two droids C-3PO and R2-D2. After delivering R2-D2's message to hermit Ben Kenobi, Ben tells Luke that his father was a Jedi and presents him with his father's lightsaber and then tells him that his father was murdered by a traitorous Jedi. Ben offers to take Luke to the planet Alderaan and train him in the ways of the Force, but Luke rejects his offer.\"\n",

But Lando frees Vader's other captives and they may rescue Solo but are too late as Fett escapes with Solo's frozen body.\"\n",

Darth Vader captures her on board the ship Tantive IV, where she is acting as a spy for the Rebel Alliance. He accuses her of being a traitor and demands to know the location of the secret technical plans of the Death Star, the Galactic Empire's most powerful weapon. Unknown to Vader, the young Senator has hidden the plans inside the Astromech droid R2-D2 and has sent it to find Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi on the nearby planet of Tatooine.\"\n",
